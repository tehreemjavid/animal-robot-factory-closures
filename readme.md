# Animal Robot Factory

This application is a frontend website that makes use of closures. After starting up and running the application, your goal is to walk through the existing code and describe how it works. Wherever you see `EXPLAIN` in the code, write your explanation for what is happening below. Some questions to keep in mind:

1. Where are there closures?
1. If we wanted to add a new type of robot, what file or files would we need to change?
1. How would you create the same application without using closures?
1. If you wanted to change the requirements so that names only needed to be unique per animal, how would you do so?

## Description

Animal Robot Factory is a page that allows you to create many types of animal robots. Each robot must have a unique name. If any robot name collides with any other, no matter what kind of robot it is, an error will be thrown.

## Setup
